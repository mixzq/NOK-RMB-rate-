NAME

  sendgrid-mail -- send mail via SendGrid

SYNOPSIS

  sendgrid-mail [-k api-key] [-E] [--html] [-s subject] [-c cc-addr] [-b bcc-addr] [--from=from-addr] [--replyTo=replyto-addr] to-addr

  You can use `sendgrid-mail` as a drop-in replacement to BSD `mail` if you set
  SENDGRID_API_KEY and SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM environment variables. See
  *ENVIRONMENT*, below.

INSTALL

  npm install -g sendgrid-mail

OPTIONS

  The following options are compatible with BSD mail.

  -E
  --suppressEmpty
      OPTIONAL
      Do not send messages with an empty body.

  -s <subject>
  --subject=<subject>
      OPTIONAL
      Specify subject on command line. (Only the first argument after the
      -s flag is used as a subject; be careful to quote subjects containing
      spaces.)

  -c <cc-addr>
  --cc=<cc-addr>
      OPTIONAL
      Send carbon copies to cc-addr list of users. The cc-addr argument
      should be a comma-separated list of email addresses.

  -b <bcc-addr>
  --bcc=<bcc-addr>
      OPTIONAL
      Send blind carbon copies to bcc-addr list of users. The bcc-addr
      argument should be a comma-separated list of email addresses.

  The following options are specific to this program and used when calling
  SendGrid's API v3 /mail/send endpoint.

  -k <api key>
  --key=<api key>
      REQUIRED
      Set a SendGrid API key. Can also be set by defining SENDGRID_API_KEY.

  --from=<from-addr>
      REQUIRED
      Set the from-addr for outgoing messages. Can also be set by defining
      SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM.

      **IMPORTANT** from-addr must be a verified sender for your SendGrid
      account.

  --replyTo=<replyto-addr>
      OPTIONAL
      Set the reply-to field for outgoing messages. Can also be set by
      defining SENDGRID_MAIL_REPLYTO. If unset, defaults to $REPLYTO.

  --html
      OPTIONAL
      Indicate that mail body content type is "text/html". If unset, mail
      content type is "text/plain".

EMAIL ADDRESS FORMATS

  Email addresses (from-addr, replyto-addr, to-addr, cc-addr, and bcc-addr)
  can be formatted as email only (e.g., "john.doe@example.com") or name and
  email (e.g., "John Doe <john.doe@example.com>").

ENVIRONMENT

  You can specify the following environment variables in the environment or
  in ~/.sendgrid-mailrc. Environment variables set from ~/.sendgrid-mailrc
  will not override variables already set in the environment.

  SENDGRID_API_KEY

  SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM

  SENDGRID_MAIL_REPLYTO

  Notably, when you set SENDGRID_API_KEY and SENDGRID_MAIL_FROM, you can use
  sendgrid-mail as a drop-in replacement to BSD's mail command.

EXAMPLES

  echo 'test email body' | sendgrid-mail -s 'test email subject' recipient@example.com --from=verifiedsender@verifieddomain.tld
